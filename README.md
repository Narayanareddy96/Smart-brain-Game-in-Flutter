It was great to start with flutter, I am very happy to show up my work here. I have developed this small and interesting puzzle game on #flutter. I have Successfully pushed the app to production #googleplaystore. #flutter development is very Quick and easy with #Dart programming. Please try my first Android App and give me your valuable feedback on it. Total development time 6 Days (Learning + Coding).
